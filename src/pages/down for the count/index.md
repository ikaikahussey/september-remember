The Hawaiian counting system is too difficult. Here's our current usage:

- 10 *umi*
- 11 *umi kuma kahi*
- 12 *umi kuma lua*
- 20 *iwakalua*
- 21 *iwakalua kuma kahi*
- 22 *iwakalua kuma lua*
- 30 *kanakolu*
- 31 *kanakolu kuma kahi*

&tc.

##My modest proposal is to shorten these words â€“ dramatically. 

Like so:

- 10 *umi*
- 11 *umi kahi*
- 12 *umi lua*
- 20 *iwakalua*
- 21 *lua kahi*
- 22 *lua lua*
- 30 *kanakolu*
- 31 *kolu kahi*
- 32 *kolu lua*

I'm willing to maintain the longer phrases for the tens. Let iwakalua have its due. Same for kanakolu, kanaha, etc. But please, in the interest of time and effort, allow twenty-two to simply be "two two." If that doesn't sufficiently honor the tens column, then I'll concede to "iwakalua-lua" or perhaps "iwa lua." That's clear enough, I think.
